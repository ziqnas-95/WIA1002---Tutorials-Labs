My name is Muhammad Haziq bin Nasaruddin with matric number, 23001539/3.
I am majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject.
At the moment, I am feeling very nervous and exciting about taking this subject.
This is because I am really looking forward to learn more about programming but at the
same time feeling a bit nervous because I feel like this subject has almost the same
difficulty level par to Fundamentals Of Programming which is quite hard...

I acquired A- for my previous Programming 1 course. It is not too bad.
So, I think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. 
In order to do well in the subject, I will study and give my all towards understanding and scoring this subject. 
Wish me luck!!!
